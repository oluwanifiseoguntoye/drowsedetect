# Deep Drowsiness Detector using YOLO and Pytorch!

## Introduction
This project aims to detect drowsiness in drivers using deep learning techniques. It uses YOLOv5 object detection algorithm and PyTorch deep learning framework to detect the eyes and face of the driver and classify whether the driver is drowsy or not.

## Installation
To run the deep drowsiness detector, you will need to install the following dependencies:
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6+</li>
<li>Yolov5 github repository</li>
<li>labelImg github repository</li>
<li>Pytorch 1.8+</li>
</ul>

## Results
The deep drowsiness detector was tested on a dataset of drivers and achieved an accuracy of 94%.
